# NETS213 Final Project - Crowdsourced Hashtag Summarizer

**Component 1: Selecting top-trending hashtags from Twitterâ€™s trending page that have been active for more than 24 hrs.** *(2 points)*

Selection criteria (Twitter summary, etc)

**Component 2: Online-bot tweet-to-CSV service: provides a file with ~800 tweets, specifically ones associated to a given hashtag and with a minimum of 100 likes.** *(2 points)*

**Component 3: Generation 1 of HITs to generate summaries via crowdsourcing about why a particular hashtag is trending. Three different batches of HITs per hashtag for varying sources of information given to workers** *(4 points)*

**Component 4a: Generation 2 of HITs to use crowdsourcing as quality control, where three workers workers give ratings to each summary, allowing for averaged ratings to be generated** *(4 points)*

**Component 4b: Generation of HITs from Twitter generated summaries about some of the hashtags (only one per hashtag). Yet again multiple workers will give ratings to each of these summaries and averaged ratings will be generated** *(2 points)*

**Component 5: Aggregation Module where various graphs comparing ratings in our 4 different categories (Google News, 10 tweets, 20 tweets, Twitter generated) of summaries will be generated.** *(3 points)*

**Component 6: Aggregation Module Part 2, where the best summaries are selected from each hashtag based on ratings from workers.** *(1 point)*
