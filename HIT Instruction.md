Summary Writing HITs
---------------------------------------------------------------


**NOTE FOR GRADER:** *THESE HITS are not fully on Sandbox because our HITS take a long time to complete and we would have a faster turnaround time if we used actual Mechanical Turk. Attached is proof that we posted the HITS to MTurk. We posted sample data of 10 rows onto MTurk Sandbox to showcase how the layout looks in MTurk and for you to interact with our HITs. We collected all of our real data from the regular MTurk 
website, in order to get faster turnaround on what can be time consuming tasks. *

Please make sure that you only choose one of the following HITs.

Please watch the video before beginning your work.
The 0Tweet Hashtag Summarizer's video instruction: https://vimeo.com/542115148
The 10/20Tweet Hashtag Summarizer's video instruction:https://vimeo.com/542116289

In our HIT, you will be asked to come up with a quality summary to explain why a hashtag is trending on twitter. 
You will either be given only the hashtag, 10 tweets with the hashtag or 20 tweets with the hashtags. 
The tweets will contain some information and you may only use Google News for supplemental research. 

Please view the three sections underneath instructions (summary, detailed instructions and examples) before beginning. 
When you write your summary, please keep it informational but under 3 sentences.

For this one, it is important that you view the rubric before rating the summaries. Please making sure that you adhere to the guideline. 
1 point corresponds to: missing or false information
2 or 3 points: missing half or more of the explanation
4 points: missing one or two pieces of minor information
5 points: complete, correct summary

You are only allowed to use Google News to check the validity of the information.
